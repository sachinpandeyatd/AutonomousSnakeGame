Autonomous Snake Game

A simple autonomous snake game where two AI-controlled snakes (Green and Red) compete to eat food. The snake that eats the most food in 2 minutes wins!

🎮 How It Works

The game starts with two snakes placed at random positions.

A food item spawns at a random location on the grid.

Both snakes move automatically towards the food.

The first snake to eat the food grows and earns 1 point.

The game runs for 2 minutes; the snake with the higher score wins!

If both have the same score, it’s a tie.
